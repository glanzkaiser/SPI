# About SPI
SolreyaPI (Solreya Plus Infinity) is a project to learn how to create a programming language from zero, made by us (The 8 Queens). Leader of the project is Freya, Glanz is the Programmer, Lasthrim is the advisor. 

We will see more will join in the future, anyone can contribute and learn. This is started after Glanz pray on St Mary statue at Residenza Maria Ferrari to learn how to create programming language faster than C++ but with scientific power like Julia. We are starting basically from summarizing Mathematics and get the idea of the name, we realize that Plus Infinity can be read as initial of PI, or the famous greek sign Ï€. Why Plus infinity? Because learning from the great Programming language Julia that is open source, it becomes a superpower because of contributions from programmer all around the world that are creating the packages and fixing the bugs (the Plus Infinity).

We will learn from the established programming language and read the book, while creating a book on how to create SolreyaPI, thus anyone can invent their own programming language or beyond in the future, better than the current one.
